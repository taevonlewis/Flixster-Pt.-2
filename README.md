# Project 3 - *Flixster Pt. 2*

Submitted by: **TaeVon Lewis**

**Flixster Pt. 2**is an updated version of [Flixster Pt. 1](https://github.com/lewist13/Flixster-Pt.-1/tree/uikit) that adds more advanced features such as networking and a collection view to display movies in a grid-like layout. With networking using URLSession, the app now fetches now playing movie data from The Movie DB (TMDB) API, allowing users to view more up-to-date movie information. The app also includes a UITabBarController to provide multiple ways to view movies and navigate through the app.

The main feature of Flixster Pt. 2 is the use of a UICollectionView to display movie posters in a more visually appealing way. Users can tap on a movie poster to navigate to the detail view, which includes a full description, title, and backdrop image of the selected movie. Overall, Flixster Pt. 2 is a more feature-rich version of Flixster Pt. 1 that provides a more engaging and interactive movie browsing experience for users.
